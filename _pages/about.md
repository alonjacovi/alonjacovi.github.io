I am a Ph.D student under the supervision of Prof. Yoav Goldberg, at the Natural Language Processing lab of Bar Ilan University.

My research interests are mainly in *explainable artificial intelligence* and *neural network interpretability*, with focus on natural language processing. I am also working on *imperfect information learning*, such as positive-unlabeled learning, in the context of NLP.

### Upcoming

* I am presenting a [survey-position paper on faithful interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03685) soon at ACL in June 2020.
* I will be interning at AI2, Seattle, as a research intern in October 2020.

### News

* We've just uploaded two new preprints: [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01067) (useful and practical formalization of AI explanations) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00995) (behavioral analysis of the linguistic information utilized by MLM models).
* I've been accepted to intern at the MOSAIC team of AI2 in fall 2020 :)
