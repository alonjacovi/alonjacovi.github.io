I am a Research Scientist at Google. I received my PhD under the supervision Prof. Yoav Goldberg at the Natural Language Processing lab of Bar Ilan University.

My research interests are in *explainable artificial intelligence/neural network interpretability* and *language model evaluation* in natural language processing.
