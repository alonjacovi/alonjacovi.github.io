I am a Ph.D student under the supervision of Prof. Yoav Goldberg at the Natural Language Processing lab of Bar Ilan University.

My research interests are mainly in *explainable artificial intelligence* and *neural network interpretability*, with focus on natural language processing. I am also working on *imperfect information learning*, such as positive-unlabeled learning, in the context of NLP.
