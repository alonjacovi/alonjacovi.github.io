I am a Ph.D student under the supervision of Prof. Yoav Goldberg at the Natural Language Processing lab of Bar Ilan University.

My research interests are mainly in *explainable artificial intelligence* and *neural network interpretability*, with focus on natural language processing. I am also working on *imperfect information learning*, such as positive-unlabeled learning, in the context of NLP.

### News - 2020

* October: I've started my remote internship on contrastive explainability at AI2's MOSAIC team, and also uploaded a new paper on [formalizing trust in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07487).
* September: Our paper on ["Exposing Shallow Heuristics of Relation Extraction Models with Challenge Data"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03656.pdf) was accepted to EMNLP 2020!
* August: I presented our paper on updating task-oriented dialogue systems using post-deployment escalation logs [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Crv-RZWpg) at the [KDD Converse](https://conversekdd20.github.io/) workshop, KDD 2020.
* July: I presented my [survey-position paper on faithful interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03685) at ACL 2020. 
* June: We've just uploaded two new preprints: [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01067) (useful and practical formalization of AI explanations) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00995) (behavioral analysis of the linguistic information utilized by MLM models).
