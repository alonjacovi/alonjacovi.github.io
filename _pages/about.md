I am a Ph.D student under the supervision of Prof. Yoav Goldberg at the Natural Language Processing lab of Bar Ilan University.

My research interests are mainly in *explainable artificial intelligence* and *neural network interpretability*, with focus on natural language processing. I am also working on *imperfect information learning*, such as positive-unlabeled learning, in the context of NLP.

### Upcoming

* I am presenting a [survey-position paper on faithful interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03685) soon at ACL in July 2020. Join my Q&A sessions July 7th!
* I will be interning (remotely) at AI2's MOSAIC team, Seattle, as a research intern in Fall 2020 (October~January).

### News

* We've just uploaded two new preprints: [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01067) (useful and practical formalization of AI explanations) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00995) (behavioral analysis of the linguistic information utilized by MLM models).
