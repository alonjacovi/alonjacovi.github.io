## Preprints


*Aligning Faithful Interpretations with their Social Attribution.*  
**Alon Jacovi**, Yoav Goldberg.  
[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01067)  
We present a new formalization on explanations of artificial model decisions, with highlight explanations as a motivating case-study.
 
*When Bert Forgets How To POS: Amnesic Probing of Linguistic Properties and MLM Predictions*  
Yanai Elazar, Shauli Ravfogel, **Alon Jacovi**, Yoav Goldberg.  
[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00995)  
A behavioral, causality-inspired analysis of the linguistic knowledge utilized by masked language models, using nullspace projection to remove the information from the representation and then observe the change in output. 

*Scalable Evaluation and Improvement of Document Set Expansion via Neural Positive-Unlabeled Learning*  
**Alon Jacovi**, Gang Niu, Yoav Goldberg, Masashi Sugiyama.  
[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13339)  
We apply state-of-the-art PU learning solutions to large neural models for the document set expansion (DSE) task, finding that they fail - so we propose modifications to PU learning to perform well on large models and small quantity of labeled data, with strong results. We also propose a new method of evaluation DSE models, which is scalable to a large amount of topics.
